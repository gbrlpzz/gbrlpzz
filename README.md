My focus is building lightweight tools that improve how local institutions understand their territory and make decisions—ranging from geospatial analysis and digital-twin prototypes to pairwise-comparison engines for public-policy prioritization.

Current domains of work:

* Territorial governance platforms (GovernanceOS, intervention graphs, AHP tooling)
* Geospatial workflows (QGIS, OSM, remote sensing)
* Research and documentation systems (Obsidian, automated pipelines, digital gardens)

This repository hosts selected scripts, prototypes, and public artifacts connected to my ongoing work.
